Modify Jupyter notebook metadata via cell comments

* Notes


** goals

- provide base config, allow overrides and additions
- config should give mapping from comment tag -> json
- +mapping should be able to take arg => config needs to contain functions+


*** approach1

- top level function with arg -> returns all mappings
- construct snippet as {'actual_tag': config(arg)[tag]} and evaluate it








- base.jsonnet is the base config
- another config can be provided
- create a combined snippet 'user + base' or just use base & eval with null arg
- this gives us the prefix
- now we parse the notebook looking for metadata comments, and construct a new snippet with all the actual comments, and






- json(net) file holds patterns: ={'top': [{'comment': 'replacement'}], 'cell': [...], 'prefix_top': '## nbmd:top:', 'prefix_cell': '## nbmd:'}=
- Read pattern file from command line or appdirs/config
- add entry point
- Create precommit hook https://pre-commit.com/#new-hooks
- one file at a time
